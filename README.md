# Its-Raining-Tacos

## Description

This site was created to help the user find fun new places to eat according to the weather. The main target user would be people visiting new areas that may need suggestions on where they can go to enjoy some ice cream when its hot or some hot chili when its cold. We feel this is a creative way to help tourists or people new to a neighborhood to get a good feel for what is out there for them.
